# Bon Voyage
##Introduction: Built in a two day paired hackathon, this application lets users explore the world. This front-end React app pulls data from the <a href=“https://developer.roadgoat.com/#introduction” rel=“noreferrer” target=“_blank”>Road Goat API</a> using Axios requests to display up to date information about places around the world.

## Technologies used
### HTML 
- Display Contents
- Favicon to display in the browser tab.

### CSS
- Style website with colors, frames and flex containers.

### JavaScript / React


### Bootstrap
- Layout the website.

## The approach taken:
### When load the page:
- Initially you will land in a Home page where there is a message and a button which when clicked will take you to search page where you can search a destination.

### Search page:
- while you type your destination, it will filter and show all of the matching destinations in a card with a few informations and a button to link to the single destination page.

### Single Destination page:
- When you land in the single destination page you should see some information about the destination chosen.
- A image of the destination chosen.
- A few tags that matches with the destination.
- A button that links your to AirBnb.
- A button that links you to Wikipedia to find more information about the destination chosen.

## Installation instructions:
- Run 'yarn start' from your VisualCode terminal.
- Or Click in the following link from your computer.
- https://iury-api-project.netlify.app/

## Wins and Difficulties:
- Managed to get the tags and images from an existent API.
- Unfortunatly the API was missing some data. It was a lesson to undertand and learn how to look properly in a exitente API before choosing.
